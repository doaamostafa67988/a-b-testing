# A/B Testing Project 📊

This repository contains an **A/B Testing notebook** that demonstrates how to design, analyze, and interpret an A/B experiment using Python. The project walks through the full experimental pipeline, from defining hypotheses to drawing statistically sound conclusions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

A/B testing is a statistical method used to compare two variants (A and B) to determine which one performs better based on a chosen metric.

In this project, we:

* Define the business problem and experiment goal
* Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
* Explore and clean the data
* Perform statistical testing
* Interpret results and make data-driven decisions

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## 🧪 What’s Inside

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Hypothesis Testing**

  * Null Hypothesis (H₀)
  * Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
* **Statistical Methods** (e.g., Z-test / t-test depending on data)
* **Confidence Intervals**
* **Result Interpretation & Business Decision**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas`
  * `numpy`
  * `scipy`
  * `matplotlib` / `seaborn`

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open `a-b-testing.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
